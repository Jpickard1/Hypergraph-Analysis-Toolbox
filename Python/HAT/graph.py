    :return: Clique expanded graph
    :rtype: *networkx.graph*

    The clique expansion algorithm constructs a *graph* on the same set of vertices as the hypergraph by defining an
    edge set where every pair of vertices contained within the same edge in the hypergraph have an edge between them
    in the graph. Given a hypergraph :math:`H=(V,E_h)`, then the corresponding clique graph is :math:`C=(V,E_c)` where
    :math:`E_c` is defined

    .. math::

        E_c = \{(v_i, v_j) |\ \exists\  e\in E_h \\text{ where } v_i, v_j\in e\}.

    This is called clique expansion because the vertices contained in each :math:`h\in E_h` forms a clique in :math:`C`.
    While the map from :math:`H` to :math:`C` is well-defined, the transformation to a clique graph is a lossy process,
    so the hypergraph structure of :math:`H` cannot be uniquely recovered from the clique graph :math:`C` alone [1].

    The star expansion of :math:`{H}=({V},{E}_h)` constructs a bipartite graph :math:`{S}=\{{V}_s,{E}_s\}`
