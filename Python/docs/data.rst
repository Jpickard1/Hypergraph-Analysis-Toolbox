Data
====

Development is underway for HAT to contain a set of built in multi-way datasets.
This is intended to provide examples for potential applications and ways to apply
hypergraph theory in different domains.

We are in the process of identifying and including various data to put inside of HAT, and
we welcome any and all suggestions. This development is managed from a separate branch
located `here <https://github.com/Jpickard1/Hypergraph-Analysis-Toolbox/tree/data>`_.

Data Sets
*********
The following types of data are planned to be included in the next release of HAT.

1. Pore-C networks
2. Co-citation and co-reference networks
3. Co-purchasing networks
4. Communications networks
5. Language networks
