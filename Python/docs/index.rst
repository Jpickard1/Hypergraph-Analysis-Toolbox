Introduction
============
Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox (HAT) is a software suite for the analysis and visualization of hypergraphs and
higher order structures. Motivated to investigate Pore-C data, HAT is intended as a general prupose, versatile
software for hypergraph construction, visualization, and analysis. HAT addresses the following hypergraph
problems:

1. Construction
2. Visualization
3. Expansion and numeric representation
4. Structral Properties
5. Controllability
6. Similarity Measures

The capabilities and use cases of HAT are outlined in `this notice <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011190>`_.
