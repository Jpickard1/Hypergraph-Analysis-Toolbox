Introduction
============
Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox (HAT) is a software suite for the analysis and visualization of hypergraphs and
higher order structures. Motivated to investigate Pore-C data, HAT is intended as a general prupose, versatile
software for hypergraph construction, visualization, and analysis. HAT addresses the following hypergraph
problems:

1. Construction
2. Visualization
3. Expansion and numeric representation
4. Structral Properties
5. Controllability
6. Similarity Measures

The capabilities and use cases of HAT are outlined in `this short notice <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mx8ifUtjR05ufhTXc5QgYKlwmfQjfItv/view?usp=share_link>`_.
