The [Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011190) is a general purpose software for analyzing the structure and dynamics of Hypergraphs.

Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox (HAT) is a software suite for the analysis and visualization of hypergraphs and higher order structures. Motivated to investigate Pore-C data, HAT is intended as a general prupose, versatile software for hypergraph construction, visualization, and analysis. HAT's main features include:

- Controllability and observability of higher order systems
- Hypergraph metrics: centrality, similarity, entropy, etc.
- Tensor based analysis: eigenvalues, decompositions, Kronecker products, etc.

Documentation for HAT is found [here](https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) at: https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
