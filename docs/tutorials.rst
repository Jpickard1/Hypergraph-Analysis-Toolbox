Tutorials
=========

This page contains a series of tutorials for using HAT. Every tutorial is available in both Python and MATLAB.

Python
******

Each Python tutorial open as a Google CoLab notebook and can be run online. You need to be logged into a google account in order to
access the notebooks. The links below may open to seemingly large .txt documents, in which case there will be a button near the top
to open the links in CoLab. Additionally, the tutorials can be downloaded from the links and run locally as a jupyter notebook as well.

2. `Constructing Hypergraphs from Multicorrealtions <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m4fYOhRrYYgT1wFGwY9SPcMXXk2aqQTR/view?usp=share_link>`_

MATLAB
******

Each MATLAB tutorial opens to MATLAB Online. If you have a MATLAB account you can run it online. Otherwise, you can download the tutorial file from MATLAB Online and run it as a live script locally.
