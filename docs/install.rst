Installation
============

An instillation guide for the MATLAB, Python, and Development versions of HAT is available here.

Python Distribution
*******************

The `Python distribution <https://pypi.org/project/HypergraphAnalysisToolbox/>`_ of HAT may be installed through pip:

.. code-block:: Python

   >> pip install HypergraphAnalysisToolbox

Once installed, HAT may be imported into the Python environment with the command:

.. code-block:: Python

   import HAT

The Python distribution has the following dependencies:

1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib
4. itertools
5. networkx

MATLAB Distribution
*******************

The MATLAB distribution of HAT can be installed through either the `MATLAB Central <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/121013-hypergraph-analysis-toolbox>`_. A MathWorks :code:`.mltbx` file can be downloaded from the site,
and installed through the add on manager in the MATLAB Home environment. Once installed as a toolbox, you will have access to all HAT functionality.

The MATLAB distribution has the following dependencies which need to be installed separately:

1. `TenEig — Tensor Eigenpairs Solver <https://users.math.msu.edu/users/chenlipi/teneig.html>`_

Development Distribution
************************

All implementations of HAT are managed through a `common git repository <https://github.com/Jpickard1/Hypergraph-Analysis-Toolbox>`_. This is public, so it may be
cloned and modified. If interested in modifying or contributing to HAT, please see information on the Development page and contact Joshua Pickard at jpic@umich.edu.
