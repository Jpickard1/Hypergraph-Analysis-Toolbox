Python Distribution
*******************

The `Python distribution <https://pypi.org/project/HypergraphAnalysisToolbox/>`_ of HAT may be installed through pip:

.. code-block:: Python

   >> pip install HypergraphAnalysisToolbox

Once installed, HAT may be imported into the Python environment with the command:

.. code-block:: Python

   import HAT

The Python distribution has the following dependencies:

1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib
4. itertools
5. networkx

MATLAB Distribution
*******************

The MATLAB distribution of HAT can be installed through either the `MATLAB Central <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/121013-hypergraph-analysis-toolbox>`_. A MathWorks :code:`.mltbx` file can be downloaded from the site,
and installed through the add on manager in the MATLAB Home environment. Once installed as a toolbox, you will have access to all HAT functionality.

The MATLAB distribution has the following dependencies which need to be installed separately:

1. `TenEig — Tensor Eigenpairs Solver <https://users.math.msu.edu/users/chenlipi/teneig.html>`_
